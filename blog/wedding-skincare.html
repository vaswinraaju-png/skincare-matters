    <h1>Why Skincare Is Important for Bride and Groom</h1>
    <div class="meta">Wedding prep • Skin health • Confidence & photography</div>

    <p>
      A wedding is one of the most photographed and emotionally significant moments in life.
      While outfits and makeup play a role, healthy skin forms the foundation of how both the
      bride and groom look and feel on their big day.
    </p>

    <h2>Skincare Impacts Wedding Photography</h2>
    <p>
      Wedding photography captures close-up moments under intense lighting.
      Well-cared-for skin reflects light evenly, looks smoother on camera, and
      reduces the need for heavy makeup or retouching.
    </p>

    <h2>Confidence Comes From Healthy Skin</h2>
    <p>
      When skin feels balanced and comfortable, confidence naturally follows.
      Brides and grooms who follow a simple skincare routine often feel more relaxed,
      present, and self-assured throughout wedding ceremonies and celebrations.
    </p>

    <h2>Common Skin Issues Before Weddings</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>Sudden breakouts due to stress</li>
      <li>Dullness from lack of sleep</li>
      <li>Dry or dehydrated skin from travel and climate changes</li>
      <li>Sensitivity caused by experimenting with new products</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Why Both Bride and Groom Need Skincare</h2>
    <p>
      Skincare is not gender-specific. Grooms benefit just as much from consistent
      skincare — especially when it comes to shaving comfort, oil control, and
      maintaining a healthy skin barrier.
    </p>

    <h2>When Should Wedding Skincare Start?</h2>
    <p>
      Ideally, a basic routine should begin at least 2–3 months before the wedding.
      This allows the skin to adjust, heal, and show visible improvements without
      last-minute reactions.
    </p>

    <h2>Our Honest Take</h2>
    <p>
      Wedding skincare does not need to be complicated. A gentle cleanser,
      moisturizer, sunscreen, and consistency are often enough to support
      healthy-looking skin for both bride and groom.
    </p>

    <h2>FAQs</h2>
    <p><strong>Do brides need advanced skincare treatments?</strong><br>
    Not necessarily. Consistency matters more than expensive treatments.</p>

    <p><strong>Should grooms follow a skincare routine?</strong><br>
    Yes. Simple skincare improves comfort, appearance, and confidence.</p>

    <p><strong>Can new products be tried close to the wedding?</strong><br>
    It’s better to avoid experimenting too close to the wedding day.</p>
